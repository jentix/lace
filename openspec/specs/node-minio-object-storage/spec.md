# node-minio-object-storage Specification

## Purpose

Defines the Node deployment's private S3-compatible object storage behavior for
MinIO while preserving portable binary-stream contracts and safe startup.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Node object storage uses a private verified MinIO bucket
The Node runtime SHALL use configured S3-compatible object storage for verified
media objects. It SHALL validate the endpoint, bucket name, region, access key,
secret, and positive bounded timeout at startup without logging supplied secret
values. Before accepting traffic, startup SHALL verify that its configured
bucket is reachable and exists; failure SHALL prevent readiness and serving
media rather than silently falling back to in-memory or public storage.

#### Scenario: A configured bucket is available
- **WHEN** Node starts with valid private MinIO settings and an existing bucket
- **THEN** media storage is initialized for that bucket and the service can
  become ready without exposing storage credentials or a public bucket URL

#### Scenario: Bucket validation fails
- **WHEN** the endpoint, credentials, or configured bucket are invalid or the
  bucket cannot be reached before the storage timeout
- **THEN** the Node service does not begin serving and reports only a sanitized
  configuration or dependency failure

### Requirement: Node object operations retain bounded streaming semantics
The Node storage adapter SHALL stream object writes and reads through the
portable byte-stream boundary without retaining arbitrary object bodies in
memory. Every object operation SHALL have the configured bounded timeout and
shall fail without returning a partial successful result when MinIO is absent,
times out, or reports an object-store error. A missing object read SHALL be
distinguished from a successful empty object and returned as absent.

#### Scenario: A verified object is streamed through storage
- **WHEN** an allowed media object is written and subsequently read through the
  Node storage capability
- **THEN** its byte stream and stored object length are preserved without
  exposing the bucket credentials or changing the opaque key

#### Scenario: Object storage is unavailable
- **WHEN** an object write, read, or deletion exceeds its timeout or MinIO
  returns an infrastructure error
- **THEN** the caller receives a sanitized failure and no partial response body
  is represented as a successfully stored or retrieved object
