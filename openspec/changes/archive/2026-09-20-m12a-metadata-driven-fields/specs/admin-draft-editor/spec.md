## Purpose

Defines the first browser-admin draft editor so writers can safely edit model
fields from server-supplied metadata and save one complete optimistic draft.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Draft fields are rendered from validated model metadata
The authenticated entry route SHALL load the requested entry and its matching
configured model before presenting editable content. It SHALL render title, the
collection-only slug, and every supported model-field descriptor from the
validated serializable metadata supplied by the model API. The field surface
SHALL cover text, textarea, rich text, number, boolean, date, datetime, select,
URL, and media descriptor types; it SHALL not execute callbacks or accept
unvalidated descriptor data from a response. Editable values SHALL be locally
validated against the same client-safe descriptor constraints before save, and
each field error SHALL be programmatically associated with its control.

#### Scenario: A configured form is loaded
- **WHEN** an authenticated writer opens an entry whose model has text, number,
  boolean, select, date, datetime, URL, media, textarea, or rich-text fields
- **THEN** the draft values appear in controls generated from their descriptor
  metadata with accessible labels, descriptions where configured, and the
  descriptor-appropriate constraints

#### Scenario: Client validation prevents an invalid save
- **WHEN** a writer submits a draft with a missing required value, an invalid
  select choice, a string or numeric value outside declared bounds, or another
  locally detectable descriptor violation
- **THEN** the affected control exposes an accessible error and the browser does
  not issue a draft-save request

#### Scenario: Model metadata is malformed or does not match the entry
- **WHEN** the entry route receives invalid model metadata, the model key does
  not exist, or the entry belongs to another model
- **THEN** it presents a safe error or not-found state and does not expose an
  editable form using unvalidated metadata

### Requirement: System fields have predictable collection-slug behavior
Every entry editor SHALL present title as an explicit required system field. A
collection editor SHALL additionally present slug as an explicit system field;
a page editor SHALL not render a slug control. A collection writer MAY opt into
slug suggestions derived from title. While suggestion is enabled and the slug
has not been manually changed, title edits SHALL update the suggested slug; a
manual slug edit SHALL stop automatic updates until the writer explicitly
re-enables suggestions.

#### Scenario: An opted-in suggestion follows a title
- **WHEN** a writer enables slug suggestions for an unedited collection slug
  and changes the title
- **THEN** the slug control receives the deterministic slug suggestion and the
  writer can save the suggested value as part of the complete draft

#### Scenario: A manual slug is preserved
- **WHEN** a writer manually changes a collection slug after enabling
  suggestions and subsequently changes the title
- **THEN** the manually entered slug remains unchanged and automatic suggestion
  stays disabled until the writer explicitly opts in again

#### Scenario: A page entry is edited
- **WHEN** a writer opens a page entry
- **THEN** the editor renders title and model fields but no slug control or slug
  suggestion affordance

### Requirement: Unsaved drafts are explicit and protected
The entry editor SHALL start clean from the loaded server draft, show a
distinct dirty state after an editable value differs from that draft, and SHALL
not implicitly save on typing, navigation, route reload, or unmount. Before an
in-application navigation or browser unload that would discard a dirty draft,
it SHALL require the writer to explicitly choose whether to leave; choosing to
stay SHALL retain the current local values. Loading, local-validation, saving,
saved, and save-failure states SHALL be distinguishable without relying only on
color.

#### Scenario: A dirty writer navigates away
- **WHEN** a writer changes a field and then attempts to navigate away from the
  entry route
- **THEN** the application asks for explicit confirmation before discarding the
  draft and retains the local values when the writer chooses to remain

#### Scenario: A writer leaves a pristine editor
- **WHEN** a writer has not changed the loaded draft and navigates away
- **THEN** navigation proceeds without a discard confirmation and no save
  request is sent

### Requirement: A save replaces the complete local draft only after success
An explicit Save action SHALL submit title, any applicable slug, all current
model-field values, and the preserved ordered block list through one
complete-draft request carrying the loaded draft revision as its optimistic
precondition. The editor SHALL replace its local baseline and editable state
only with the validated entry representation returned after a successful save;
it SHALL then show the returned revision and clean state. A failed save SHALL
retain the writer's values and dirty state, present a non-sensitive failure
state, and associate server validation issues with their matching controls when
the response provides field paths.

#### Scenario: A complete draft saves successfully
- **WHEN** a writer explicitly saves valid changed title, slug, or model-field
  values with the current revision
- **THEN** exactly one complete-draft request is sent and the displayed draft
  is replaced with the validated server response and its advanced revision

#### Scenario: Server field validation rejects a submitted value
- **WHEN** the server rejects a complete-draft request with documented
  field-level validation issues
- **THEN** the editor preserves the submitted values and exposes the applicable
  field errors accessibly without treating the draft as saved

#### Scenario: Save is never automatic
- **WHEN** a writer edits one or more fields but does not invoke Save
- **THEN** the client sends no draft-save request and the server draft revision
  remains unchanged
