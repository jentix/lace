## Purpose

Defines the portable relational storage foundation that preserves Lace content,
security, dispatch, and installation invariants across SQLite and D1.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Single-installation relational integrity
The system SHALL create a SQLite-compatible schema for one Lace installation
that persists content models, entries, draft and published snapshots, ordered
blocks, published routes, media metadata and reference projections, global
published state, outbox events, site-build history, idempotency records,
installation state, setup tokens, API tokens, rate-limit buckets, and the
authentication tables needed by the selected authentication provider. It SHALL
store application IDs as text and timestamps as UTC Unix milliseconds; binary
media SHALL remain outside the database. The schema SHALL restrict model kinds,
media states, build states, singleton state, and other finite lifecycle values
to the architecture-defined values.

#### Scenario: Fresh schema stores a content lifecycle aggregate
- **WHEN** a new installation stores a valid model, entry, draft snapshot, and
  ordered blocks
- **THEN** the records use their declared stable identities and relational
  fields, and no binary media payload is stored in the database

#### Scenario: Schema rejects an invalid lifecycle value
- **WHEN** a write attempts to store an unsupported content-model kind, media
  deletion status, site-build status, or non-singleton published-state key
- **THEN** the database rejects the write and leaves valid stored state intact

### Requirement: Persistence constraints preserve content and dispatch invariants
The schema SHALL enforce one page entry per model through partial uniqueness,
one globally owned published path, unique media storage keys, one idempotency
record per scope/key, and at most one unclaimed pending site-build request. It
SHALL represent outbox dispatcher leases with nullable owner and timestamp
fields. Required foreign keys and actions SHALL cascade entry/snapshot removal
to blocks, media-reference projections, and published routes; restrict deletion
of a model with entries or media with references; set entry snapshot pointers to
NULL when their snapshot is deleted; and cascade a content-model key update to
entries.

#### Scenario: Conflicting singleton or public route is rejected
- **WHEN** writes attempt to create a second singleton entry for one page model
  or assign an already-owned published path to another entry
- **THEN** the conflicting write is rejected by a uniqueness constraint

#### Scenario: Referential cleanup and protection are enforced
- **WHEN** an entry or snapshot is deleted, or deletion targets a model with
  entries or a media record with reference projections
- **THEN** dependent entry data is removed according to its cascade rule, entry
  pointers are safely cleared where needed, and protected model/media deletion
  is rejected

### Requirement: Indexed, forward-compatible database initialization
The system SHALL supply ordered forward migrations and expose the installed
migration version(s) after migration. It SHALL index model entry lists, route
lookups, blocks by snapshot and position, media-reference reverse lookups,
available outbox work, and site-build history. A newly migrated Node SQLite
database SHALL enable foreign-key enforcement and write-ahead logging every time
it is opened; those Node-specific connection settings SHALL not change the
shared SQLite/D1 schema or migration SQL.

#### Scenario: Empty database migrates and reopens safely
- **WHEN** a Node process migrates a new SQLite file and opens it again
- **THEN** all forward migrations report as installed, required tables and
  indexes exist, foreign-key enforcement and write-ahead logging are enabled,
  and a foreign-key violation is rejected

#### Scenario: Required lookup has an index
- **WHEN** a runtime queries an entry list, published route, ordered snapshot
  blocks, media references, available outbox event, or build history
- **THEN** the schema provides the corresponding declared index for a bounded
  lookup plan
