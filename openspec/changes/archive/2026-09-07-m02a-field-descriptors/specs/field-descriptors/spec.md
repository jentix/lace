## Purpose

Defines the portable, code-first field descriptors that Lace models and blocks
use to derive static value types and safe admin-form metadata from one source.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Initial portable field descriptor set

The content package SHALL expose a discriminated `FieldDefinition` contract and
builder for each MVP field kind: text, textarea, rich text, number, boolean,
date, datetime, select, URL, and media. Every completed definition SHALL retain
its kind and normalized common options (`label`, `description`, `required`, and
`defaultValue`) in a portable representation. Builders SHALL preserve the
corresponding TypeScript value type, including the literal union of select
choices where statically known.

#### Scenario: Define each MVP field kind

- **WHEN** configuration code creates one descriptor through each supported
  `field.*` builder
- **THEN** each result is distinguishable by its field kind and carries the
  field kind's inferred value type

#### Scenario: Infer a select value from choices

- **WHEN** configuration code defines a select field with literal choices
- **THEN** its inferred value type accepts those choices and rejects other
  values at compile time

### Requirement: Serializable normalized configuration

The content package SHALL accept only JSON-serializable builder option values
and SHALL return a detached, normalized field definition. The returned
definition and its derived form metadata SHALL survive a JSON stringify/parse
round trip without executable values, runtime schemas, symbols, cyclic
references, non-finite numbers, or host-specific objects.

#### Scenario: Project metadata for an admin form

- **WHEN** a caller derives form metadata from a valid field definition
- **THEN** the metadata exposes the field kind, normalized common options, and
  applicable type-specific options using JSON data only

#### Scenario: Reject a non-portable option value

- **WHEN** a builder receives an option graph containing a function, symbol,
  bigint, cyclic reference, non-finite number, or non-plain object
- **THEN** configuration normalization fails with a descriptive error before a
  field definition is returned

### Requirement: Field-specific option consistency

The content package SHALL support string length bounds for text and textarea,
numeric lower and upper bounds for number, and a non-empty set of unique string
choices for select. It SHALL reject malformed option types, a lower bound that
exceeds an upper bound, duplicate select choices, and a default value that does
not conform to the same field kind and declared constraints.

#### Scenario: Normalize valid constrained options

- **WHEN** a caller supplies valid common and type-specific options with a
  conforming default value
- **THEN** the builder returns a normalized definition and metadata containing
  those options

#### Scenario: Reject contradictory constraints

- **WHEN** a text or textarea field has a minimum length above its maximum
  length, or a number field has a minimum above its maximum
- **THEN** configuration normalization fails before the definition is returned

#### Scenario: Reject an invalid select default

- **WHEN** a select field's default is absent from its declared choices
- **THEN** configuration normalization fails before the definition is returned

### Requirement: Default-value compatibility

The content package SHALL validate every supplied default value against the
field's current descriptor contract during normalization. For this session, a
date, datetime, URL, and media default SHALL be a string; a rich-text default
SHALL be a JSON object; text and textarea defaults SHALL observe their length
bounds; numbers SHALL be finite and observe numeric bounds; booleans and
selects SHALL match their declared values. Semantic URL and rich-text document
validation remains the responsibility of Session 2B.

#### Scenario: Reject a default with the wrong value kind

- **WHEN** a caller supplies a default whose runtime kind does not match its
  field descriptor
- **THEN** configuration normalization fails and identifies the invalid default

#### Scenario: Preserve a valid rich-text default as portable data

- **WHEN** a caller supplies a JSON-object default for a rich-text field
- **THEN** the descriptor retains a detached JSON-serializable copy without
  attempting Session 2B document-semantic validation
