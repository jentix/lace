## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Ordered block aggregate validation
The system SHALL validate a complete flat ordered block aggregate against a
model's allowed block types and a registry in draft or publish mode. Each block
SHALL have a unique stable block key, accepting canonical ULID-format keys as
well as existing named stable keys, registered block type, exact current
schema version, and JSON data validated by that block's fields; it SHALL reject
unknown properties, duplicate keys, malformed keys, disallowed or unregistered
types, stale versions, malformed data, oversized data, and more than the shared
top-level block limit. Draft mode SHALL permit fields required by a block to be
absent unless their defaults supply them; publish mode SHALL require them.

#### Scenario: Validate a complete draft aggregate
- **WHEN** a model permits a registered block and a draft supplies one or more
ordered blocks with unique keys and valid present data
- **THEN** validation returns the normalized block data including applicable defaults

#### Scenario: Accept a browser-generated stable key
- **WHEN** a draft block has a canonical ULID-format key, including one beginning with a digit
- **THEN** aggregate validation accepts and retains that key through draft and publish validation

#### Scenario: Reject a stale or disallowed block
- **WHEN** an aggregate contains a block type absent from the model's allowed
types, a registry-missing type, or a schema version other than its registry definition
- **THEN** validation fails at that block's deterministic path

#### Scenario: Reject malformed or duplicate keys
- **WHEN** an aggregate contains an invalid stable key or repeats a block key
- **THEN** validation fails at that block's key path
